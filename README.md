# Traficar Fleet Fuel Consumption Monitor

This project monitors the Traficar car-sharing fleet and tracks fuel consumption in **absolute liters** (not percentages) using data from the [Fioletowe API](https://fioletowe.live/docs/).

## Latest Update: Complete Data Collection

**NEW APPROACH**: The monitor now stores **ALL car readings** on every run (every 10 minutes), not just consumption events. This provides:

- **Complete activity tracking** - See when cars are available/unavailable
- **Better consumption analysis** - Calculate fuel usage retrospectively with full data
- **Fleet utilization insights** - Understand usage patterns across the entire fleet
- **No data loss** - All readings preserved for future analysis

### How It Works

1. **`monitor_traficar.py`** runs every 10 minutes (GitHub Actions)
   - Fetches current state of all cars
   - Stores **everything** to `data/all_readings.csv`
   - Still tracks real-time consumption events to `data/consumption.csv`

2. **`calculate_fuel_consumption.py`** analyzes stored data
   - Reads all historical readings
   - Calculates consumption by comparing consecutive readings
   - Generates activity and consumption reports

## Previous Changes

### What Was Fixed

The previous version had a critical flaw - it calculated consumption in **percentages** instead of absolute fuel amounts. This led to incorrect metrics like:
- Total consumption: 1936%
- Average: 64.53% per 10 minutes

### Implementation

The updated version:

1. **Fetches car model data** including `maxFuel` capacity for each model
2. **Converts percentages to liters** using the formula: `liters = (percent / 100) * maxFuel`
3. **Stores ALL readings** to `data/all_readings.csv` on every run
4. **Calculates consumption separately** from the complete dataset
5. **Stores rich data** for analysis: timestamp, car ID, car name, model type, fuel levels, availability

## Data Structure

### all_readings.csv (PRIMARY DATA SOURCE)
```csv
timestamp,car_id,car_name,model_id,model_type,fuel_percent,fuel_liters,available,max_fuel
2025-11-06 15:30:00,49853,RENAULT Clio IV,5,1,65.0,26.00,True,40.0
2025-11-06 15:30:00,49854,RENAULT Clio V,12,1,42.0,16.80,False,40.0
```

This file stores **ALL readings** from every monitoring cycle, regardless of fuel level changes. This comprehensive data allows for:
- Tracking car activity patterns (available vs unavailable)
- Identifying when cars are being used
- Calculating fuel consumption retrospectively
- Analyzing fleet utilization

### Columns (all_readings.csv)
- `timestamp` - When the reading was taken
- `car_id` - Unique car identifier
- `car_name` - Car model name (e.g., "RENAULT Clio IV")
- `model_id` - Car model ID
- `model_type` - Model type (1 or 2, as filtered from API)
- `fuel_percent` - Fuel level as percentage (0-100)
- `fuel_liters` - Fuel level in liters
- `available` - Whether car is available for rent (True/False)
- `max_fuel` - Maximum fuel capacity for this model

### calculated_consumption.csv
Generated by `calculate_fuel_consumption.py` from all_readings.csv:
```csv
timestamp,car_id,car_name,model_type,consumption_liters,prev_fuel_liters,curr_fuel_liters,time_diff_minutes,prev_timestamp
2025-11-06 15:40:00,49853,RENAULT Clio IV,1,3.50,28.00,24.50,10.0,2025-11-06 15:30:00
```

### Columns (calculated_consumption.csv)
- `timestamp` - When the lower fuel level was detected
- `car_id` - Unique car identifier
- `car_name` - Car model name
- `model_type` - Model type
- `consumption_liters` - Fuel consumed in liters
- `prev_fuel_liters` - Previous fuel level in liters
- `curr_fuel_liters` - Current fuel level in liters
- `time_diff_minutes` - Time between readings
- `prev_timestamp` - When the previous reading was taken

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Monitor Manually

```bash
python monitor_traficar.py
```

This will:
1. Fetch current car data from the API
2. Load car models (cached after first run)
3. **Store ALL readings to `data/all_readings.csv`** (NEW - always happens)
4. Compare with previous state
5. Record real-time consumption events (if any)
6. Save current state

**Note**: Every run now stores complete data for all cars, making `data/all_readings.csv` grow with each execution.

### Calculate Fuel Consumption

```bash
python calculate_fuel_consumption.py
```

This will:
1. Load all readings from `data/all_readings.csv`
2. Analyze car activity patterns (availability, usage frequency)
3. Calculate fuel consumption by comparing consecutive readings
4. Generate `data/calculated_consumption.csv` with detailed consumption events
5. Display summary statistics

**Benefits of this approach**:
- All raw data is preserved
- Consumption calculation can be refined later without re-collecting data
- Activity patterns can be analyzed independently
- No data is lost if consumption detection logic changes

### Analyzing Data (Legacy)

```bash
python analyze_consumption.py
```

This generates visualizations from consumption data:
- Summary statistics (total consumption, events, averages)
- Breakdown by car model
- Breakdown by model type
- Three visualization plots:
  - `consumption_over_time.png` - Hourly and cumulative consumption
  - `model_comparison.png` - Top models by total and average consumption
  - `consumption_distribution.png` - Distribution histograms and box plots

**Note**: This script can work with either `data/consumption.csv` (real-time) or `data/calculated_consumption.csv`

## GitHub Actions

The monitoring script runs automatically every 10 minutes via GitHub Actions. Results are committed back to the repository.

To trigger manually:
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Monitor Traficar Fleet"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## Logic Details

### Consumption Detection

```python
if previous_fuel_liters > current_fuel_liters:
    # Consumption detected
    consumption = previous_fuel_liters - current_fuel_liters
    
elif previous_fuel_liters < current_fuel_liters:
    # Refueling detected - update state, no consumption logged
    
else:
    # No change - car not used
```

### Model Filtering

Only tracks vehicles with `modelType` 1 or 2 (excludes electric vehicles and other types).

## Example Output

```
[2025-11-03 14:23:15] Starting monitoring cycle...
Cached 50 car models
Retrieved data for 832 cars
Recorded 45 consumption events
Total consumption: 178.50 liters

Consumption by model:
  RENAULT Clio IV: 89.25L (23 events)
  RENAULT Clio V: 67.80L (18 events)
  DACIA Sandero: 21.45L (4 events)
```

## API Information

- **Base URL**: `https://fioletowe.live/api/v1`
- **Endpoints used**:
  - `/cars?zoneId=1` - Current car data
  - `/car-models?modelType={1,2}&electric=false` - Car specifications
- **Documentation**: https://fioletowe.live/docs/

## Notes

- Consumption is only recorded when fuel decreases by > 0.1 liters (avoids rounding errors)
- Cars with unknown models are skipped
- First run establishes baseline (no consumption recorded)
- Model data is cached to reduce API calls

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- Track distance driven (if available in API)
- Calculate fuel efficiency (L/100km)
- Detect anomalies (unusually high consumption)
- Add geographic analysis by zone
- Create dashboard for real-time monitoring
